    Quadtree Truchet
    ----------------

      A multiscale, multitile, overlapped, weaved Truchet pattern. However, since
    that description is a little verbose, I figured that a quadtree Truchet was as 
    good a description as any. :) The mild weave effect is provided via the
    "INCLUDE_LINE_TILES" define.

    In order to produce a varied looking Truchet pattern, there are a couple of
    simple things you can try: One is to use more than one tile, and the other is 
    to stitch weaved tiles together to produce a cool under-over effect. There are 
      a few examples on Shadertoy of each, which are easy enough to find -- Just do
    a search for "Truchet" and look for the multitile and weaved examples.

      Lesser known variations include using Truchet tiles that overlap one another, 
      and stitching together multiscaled tiles -- usually on something like a quadtree 
      grid. This example uses elements of all of the aforementioned.

    In the past, I've combined two non-overlapping tile scales, but had never 
      considered taking it beyond that... until I came across Christopher Carlson's
    article, "Multi-Scale Truchet Patterns." If you follow the link below and refer
    to the construction process, you'll see that the idea behind it is almost 
    rudimentary. As a consequence, I figured that it'd take me five minutes to put 
    the ideas into pixel shader form. Unfortunately, they say the dumber you are, 
    the more overconfident you'll be, and to cut a long story short... It took me 
    longer than five minutes. :D

    The code below is somewhat obfuscated and strewn with defines - The defines are
    my fault, since I wanted to provide a few rendering options. However, the 
    remaining complication boils down to the necessity to render overlapping tiles
    on a quadtree grid in an environment that doesn't allow random pixel access. The 
    only example along those lines I could find on here was IQ's hierachical Voronoi 
    demonstration, which is pretty cool, but it contains a lot of nested iterations.
    Rendering tiles in that manner wasn't really sufficient, so I had to write
    things in a way that used fewer iterations, but it was at the cost of legibility.

    Either way, the idea is pretty simple: Construct a grid, randomly render some 
    Truchet tiles, subdivide the remaining squares into four, randomly render some 
      more tiles in reverse color order, then continue ad infinitum. By the way, I
    constructed this on the fly using the best method I could think of at the time.
    However, if anyone out there has a more elegant solution, feel free to post it. :)
    
    Naturally, the idea can be extended to 3D. Three levels with this particular 
    setup might be a little slow. However, two levels using a non overlapping tile
    is definitely doable, so I intend to produce an example along those lines in the 
    near future.
